# leaflet-coverage

A Leaflet plugin for visualizing [coverages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_data) with the help of the [JavaScript Coverage API](https://github.com/neothemachine/coverage-jsapi). Currently, it supports the domain types defined within [CoverageJSON](https://github.com/neothemachine/coveragejson).

Note that to *load* a coverage you have to use another library, depending on which formats you want to support. The only currently known coverage loader that can be used is the [covjson-reader](https://github.com/neothemachine/covjson-reader) for the [CoverageJSON](https://github.com/neothemachine/coveragejson) format.
